## Highcharts and AngularJS Demo 
####To Run: 
Simply clone and open `index.html`.

####Description:
I would like to demonstrate the following:
1. How high charts would would with AngularJS
2. How the charts can look and behave with a refresh rate of up to 10Hz. 
3. It has support for all the charts we require for the project.

### Notes
This demo utilizes an AngularJS [directive](https://github.com/pablojim/highcharts-ng). This is the ideal way to make the library and the Angular "framework" work together.
